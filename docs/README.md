# Slackbot Docs

By the time you're done, you'll have created and customized 
your own slackbot.

## BUT WHY???

Slackbots are great for a number of things.

Have a database query you have to run often? Just send a ping to your database 
bot and she'll get the results for you. Want to be warned that something is
wrong with your code? Instead of just logging the information and hoping to
catch it, have your robot warn you immediately. Have an annoying boss who wants
you to let him know as soon as X happens. Make your robot name very similar to
your own and have it warn him instead. He can even send simple requests to
your bot (maybe thinking it's you) and get timely responses. What will you do
with it?

## Overview

Start with the sample provided, then create your own.

### Build a Sample Bot

1. Create Your Slack [Workspace](workspace.md)
2. Setup [Slack App](slack_app.md) within your Workspace
  * this will identify the username and get the OAuth Token
  * and Create/Update your Slackbot Configuration
4. Run the [Sample](slackbots.md)

### Create your Own Bot

_assuming you already have a workspace from above_

1. Setup [Slack App](slack_app.md) within your Workspace
2. Update your Slackbot Configuration
3. Copy the [Sample](slackbots.md) and modify the given python code
