# Slackbot Docs

By the time you're done, you'll have created and customized 
your own slackbot.

## BUT WHY???

Slackbots are great for a number of things.

Have a database query you have to run often? Just send a ping to your database 
bot and she'll get the results for you. Want to be warned that something is
wrong with your code? Instead of just logging the information and hoping to
catch it, have your robot warn you immediately. Have an annoying boss who wants
you to let him know as soon as X happens. Make your robot name very similar to
your own and have it warn him instead. He can even send simple requests to
your bot (maybe thinking it's you) and get timely responses. What will you do
with it?
